# Customer Terminate Service (CTS)

## Running CTS locally

You can either run CTS locally inside IntelliJ (using Run-configurations) or by using the included Gradle wrapper.

When starting CTS locally for development and testing, you want to make sure that the following
Spring profiles are active: `testability,dev`

They are activated automatically when running Gradle (`./gradlew bootRun`), but in IntelliJ you have to add the Spring
profiles to your Run-configuration (`Active profiles`) before starting the service.
